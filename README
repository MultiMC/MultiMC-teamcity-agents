# MultiMC builder setup

This describes how to set up MultiMC teamcity build agents so they aren't annoying.

1. Copy `env.example` to `.env`
2. Bring up all the machines with `docker-compose up` and observe the auth tokens they get from TC
3. Bring all the build agents down
4. Fill in the real auth token into `.env`
5. Bring the agents up, remove all dead ones from TC, authorize the running ones
